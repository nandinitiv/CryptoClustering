# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, I used Python in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. I used the K-Means method of clustering both without optimization and with PCA optimization. I compared the elbow curves generated from the non-optimized data and optimized data as well as the cluster plots to better understand the impact of PCA optimization.

Resources used for this challenge include course material, course-provided starter code, collaboration with classmates, AskBCS Learning Assistants, Stack Overflow, Chat GPT, GitHub, Pandas documentation, and Python documentation.
